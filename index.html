                <p> 
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  i don’t really know much about you yet, but i hope you’ll allow me to share this honestly. At first I had always believed that no one will ever captivate me, but all of a sudden when I saw you at the corner of my eyes, you really got me captivated.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  maybe it’s strange or sudden, but something about you caught my attention in a way i didn’t expect. I still remember how i used to tease you alongside kuya cason or how i talk to you during the anaphy lab. At some point I realized I did like you. For some reason, i didn't know that I had treated you differently apart from the other girls from our class, but I'll be honest with you, yes i was captivated by your looks, the way you put your make up on, the way you do your lashes and also you really have such beautiful eyes. Every time we locked eyes at each other or i just assumed that we did locked eyes. I feel kinda nervous but fascinated at the same time. I don't really know why do I feel that way when looking right into those loving eyes.
                    </span> 
			&emsp;  Other than that, what sets you apart from the others is your inner qualities. Maybe I still need to know you more to really see what's inside there but from what I had observed during our brief interactions, you were a gentle girl but there will always be a "maldita" side behind that.
                    <br> <br>
                    </span>
			&emsp;   I never intended to feel like this but i did feel something for you. it’s new for me, and i’m not used to saying things like this, but i just wanted to let it out rather than keep it to myself. I'm not asking for anything back, and i don’t want this to make things awkward between us. I just wanted to be honest with how I feel. Sorry if it took some time for me to tell all this to you. that’s all. I hope you’re doing well
